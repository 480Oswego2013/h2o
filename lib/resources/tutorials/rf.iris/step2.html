<p>
The first step of random forest algorithm is model building. 
During this step a set of decision trees is prepared based on training data.
In this tutorial, we will use <a href='http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris'>Iris dataset</a> for forest building.
</p>

<p>
Iris dataset is provided <a href="/datasets/iris.csv">here</a> in the form of CSV file.
Please, download it and save it on your disk.  
</p>

<p>
To upload the dataset into H2O application, please, use the menu option <span class='label' onmouseout="$('.dropdown-toggle').dropdown('toggle');">Data &gt; Upload</span> or direct <a href="/PutFile.html" target="_blank">link</a>.
